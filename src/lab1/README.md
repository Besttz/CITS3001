# CITS3001 Week 2 Lab & Workshop
This floder is the lab and workshop program of Week 2, and also week 1.<br>
Start to write the Strings Algorithm from 17:30 Aug 8, spend almost two whole day to finish them. 
But unfortunately I still didn't finish the Boyer-Moore algorithms.<br>
Cause I'm lazy, for the LCS I just wrote the dynamic programming one, 
anyway I understood the basic idea of the normal recursive one.<br>
OKay I have to move on to the next learning items.<br>
